# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction - Telecom Industry

Predictive analytics project to identify at-risk customers and enable proactive retention strategies.

## 🎯 Project Overview
Built machine learning models to predict customer churn with 85% accuracy, identifying key drivers and calculating potential revenue impact.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python** | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## 📈 Key Results
- **Model Performance**: 85% ROC-AUC (Random Forest)
- **Top Churn Drivers**: Contract type, tenure, monthly charges
- **Business Impact**: Identified high-risk customers for targeted retention

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identified churn patterns and key relationships
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Feature engineering, encoding, scaling
3. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
4. **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, feature importance
5. **Business Analysis**: Revenue impact and customer segmentation

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle Telco Customer Churn
- **Size**: 7,043 customers, 21 features
- **Target**: Binary (Churn: Yes/No)
- **Churn Rate**: 26.5%

## 💡 Key Findings
- Month-to-month contracts have **42% churn rate** vs 3% for long-term contracts
- Customers with tenure < 12 months are at **highest risk**
- Total services subscribed inversely correlates with churn
- Model can identify **high-risk customers** for proactive retention campaigns

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Deploy model as REST API using Flask
- Create real-time dashboard for monitoring
- Implement A/B testing for retention strategies
- Integrate with CRM systems
